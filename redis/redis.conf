# Basic Redis Configuration for Production Simulation

# Port (already handled by Docker, but good to have)
port 6379

# Enable AOF (Append Only File) for better durability
appendonly yes
appendfilename "appendonly.aof"

# How often to fsync data to disk (everysec is a good balance)
appendfsync everysec

# RDB snapshotting (still useful for backups, Redis uses it for replication sync too)
# Default is: save 900 1 / save 300 10 / save 60 10000
# You can adjust these or leave default if AOF is primary
save 900 1
save 300 10
save 60 10000

# Log level
loglevel notice

# If you were to set a password (not strictly needed if only accessible within Docker network)
# requirepass yoursecurepassword

# Maxmemory and policy (IMPORTANT for production to prevent Redis from consuming all RAM)
# Example: Set maxmemory to 256MB and use allkeys-lru eviction policy
# maxmemory 256mb
# maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru

# TCP keepalive (helps with firewall issues, 300 is a common default)
tcp-keepalive 300
