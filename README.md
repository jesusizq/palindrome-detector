# Palindrome Detector

## Overview

Design and develop a service that allows us to detect palindromes.

It is exposed using a REST API with JSON that allows us to:

- Detect if a random string is a palindrome from a language field and a text field.
- List all the detections on the system, allowing filters by date and language.
- Get the results of one palindrome detection.
- Remove a detection.
